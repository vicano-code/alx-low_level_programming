## Low Level Programming
The folders in this repository contain codes written with the C programming language, illustrating essential concepts of programming. The files were named to reference the concepts (i.e. pointers, recursion, malloc, free, structures, function pointers, variadic functions, linked lists, etc). The folders contain bash scripts and functions relating to the particular concept. Some functions in the C standard library were recreated to demonstrate how they work (e.g. _strcpy, _strlen, _strcat etc).
